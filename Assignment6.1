Step 1: Find the mean:
($1550 + $1700 + $900 + $850 + $1000 + $950)/6 = $1158.33

Step 2: Subtract the mean from each value. This gives the differences:
$1550 – $1158.33 = $391.67
$1700 – $1158.33 = $541.67
$900 – $1158.33 = -$258.33
$850 – $1158.33 = -$308.33
$1000 – $1158.33 = $158.33
$950 – $1158.33 = $208.33

Step 3: Square the differences  found in Step 3:
$(391.672)*(391.672) = 153405.3889
$(541.672)*(541.672) = 293406.3889
$(-258.332)*(-258.332) = 66734.3889
$(-308.332)*(-308.332) = 95067.3889
$(158.332)*(158.332) = 25068.3889
$(208.332)*(208.332) = 43401.3889

Step 4: Add up all of the squares  found in Step 3 and divide by 5 (which is 6 – 1):
(153405.3889 + 293406.3889 + 66734.3889 + 95067.3889 + 25068.3889 + 43401.3889) / 5 = 135416.66668

Step 5: Find the square root of the number  found in Step 4 (the variance):
√135416.66668 = 367.99
The standard deviation is 367.99.
